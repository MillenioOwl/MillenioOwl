## Hello, I'm MillenioOwl

This is my **sub-account**—a place for experiments, random projects, and things I wouldn’t dare post elsewhere.  
My **main account**? Well, it’s shrouded in secrecy...  
I’m a bit too hesitant to be *truly* creative over there. 😶‍🌫️  

### About Me  
- 🎓 **Self-taught student**, always learning and exploring new technologies.  
- 🎮 **Gamer**, enjoying both strategy and puzzle games.  
- 🛠️ Building projects, solving problems, and improving every day.

I'm from a place... but do you really know where? The mystery remains. 🕵️‍♂️  

Lastly, I love owls. 🦉

You're looking where you shouldn't!  
I see you peeking at this secret... but now that you've found it, I guess you know too much.  
But remember, some mysteries are meant to stay unsolved. 😉
